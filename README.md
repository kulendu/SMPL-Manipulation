This is a Python tutorial on using basic functions for manipulating [SMPL](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/) and visualizing it using [Polyscope](https://polyscope.run/py/) and [Trimesh](https://trimesh.org/) libraries. 

File Descriptions:
1. `vis_amass_trimesh.py`: Visualizer for the frames of AMASS sequence data.
2. `pose_dump.py`: Extracting the pose, betas, and translations in a pkl file
3. `blender_pose_vis.py`: Script for rendering the poses in armature form and then iterating through the frames
